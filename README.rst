django-chess is written in Django/Python/Jquery/JqueryUI.

django-chess 0.0.1 introduces a single player chess game against yourself for now.

* The framework combined with the methods used was thought out by programmer and software developer Jaco Thiart.

* This game was initially written in Django/Python/Jquery/JqueryUI as a multi-player strategy game and was then ported to Unity3D(http://wooglie.com/games/strategy/Chess) and after that it was ported back to django-chess on github as a initial single player strategy game against yourself, identified by version 0.0.1.

* This is just the start for gaming in Django, there is more in store for django-chess in the future!

* The ported version in Unity3D do have artificial intelligence to an extend with level, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced!

* This need to be included into django-chess as well as multi-player gaming with the addition of chess moves Castling and En-Passant.

* django-chess is compatible in all major browsers including Ie6.

Thanks for playing!
